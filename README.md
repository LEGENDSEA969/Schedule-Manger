## Schedule Manager 
Is a Python application designed with students—and really anyone frustrated by cluttered, hard-to-read timetables—in mind. Built on PySide6, it delivers a sleek, modern user interface that feels intuitive and accessible from the moment you open it. Whether you’re dealing with a schedule buried in a PDF or organizing a new one from scratch, Schedule Manager brings the text right into the app, giving you the power to edit, rearrange, and refine every detail to your liking. The real magic happens when you convert your adjustments into a structured table, where every row and column falls neatly into place, eliminating the chaos of disorganized lists and unreadable blocks of text. With Schedule Manager, you have full control—modify subjects, swap times, fix typos, and ensure that everything is perfectly aligned before finalizing your schedule. The thoughtfully designed interface is easy on the eyes, reducing visual fatigue and letting you focus on what matters without getting overwhelmed or lost. You get seamless PDF text extraction, real-time editing, and instant table generation, all within a single streamlined workspace. What used to be a stressful, hours-long ordeal—cleaning up and organizing your schedule—becomes a straightforward, manageable task that saves time and spares you the headache. For students, this means less time wrestling with formatting issues and more time focusing on what’s actually important.

## The Problem It Solves
Every academic term, students are handed schedules in formats that are inconvenient and confusing. Colleges and universities often distribute PDFs filled with ambiguous headings like “Period 1” or “Period 15,” and rarely provide a clear, visual layout that shows exactly when each class takes place. When you try to copy this information, the formatting collapses—lines mix together, spacing disappears, and what should be a simple timetable turns into a tangled mess that’s nearly impossible to decipher. If you’re trying to plan your week or ensure you’re in the right place at the right time, you’ll likely end up rewriting everything by hand, spending hours just to create a usable schedule. Mistakes are easy to make, and the process is tedious, adding unnecessary stress to an already busy semester.

It’s not just about clarity—it’s about usability. A jumbled schedule makes it hard to spot overlaps, free periods, or consistent routines. You might miss a lab session because it was buried in a paragraph or show up to the wrong room because the location was listed in a separate, unaligned column. These small errors waste time, create anxiety, and pull your focus away from your studies. And if you’re someone who likes to color-code, add reminders, or share your timetable with peers, the manual reformatting becomes a multi-step nightmare involving spreadsheets, highlighting, and constant tweaking.

Schedule Manager addresses all of these frustrations head-on. You can import your schedule text directly from a PDF or paste it into the editor, quickly clean up any formatting issues, and rearrange the information as you see fit. The app empowers you to structure days, periods, and subjects in the way that makes the most sense for your needs. Once you’re satisfied, Schedule Manager converts your work into a clean, visually organized timetable. Every day, period, and subject is clearly displayed in an easy-to-read table that makes planning your week effortless. Instead of wrestling with a wall of text or spending hours fixing formatting, you can transform confusion into clarity in just a few steps. The result is a reliable, error-free schedule that you can depend on, reducing stress and freeing up your time for studying, extracurriculars, or anything else you’d rather be doing.

## How It Works
Getting started with Schedule Manager is refreshingly simple. The process begins in the built-in text editor, where you can either type out your schedule manually or import text directly from a PDF. The app handles the extraction automatically, dropping the text straight into the editor so you can immediately begin making adjustments. There’s no rigid template or strict formatting requirements—you have the flexibility to organize your days, periods, and subjects in whatever format works best for you. You can fix spacing, clarify ambiguous entries, or completely restructure the information to suit your preferences.

Once your schedule text is ready, switching to the table view is as easy as a click. Schedule Manager reads your organized text, parses the information, and instantly generates a neat timetable with clearly defined rows and columns. Each row corresponds to a time slot or class period, while each column represents a day of the week, offering a clear visual overview of your schedule. You can customize the table further—adjust column widths, apply color coding to different subjects or days, and even add notes or reminders to specific cells. This isn’t just a static display; it’s an interactive layout that helps you see your week at a glance.

If you notice an error or want to make further adjustments, you can move seamlessly back and forth between the editor and the table view, refining your schedule until it’s just right. This fluid workflow means you’re never locked into a single format or forced to redo your work from scratch. You can experiment with different arrangements—grouping morning classes together, highlighting breaks, or separating lectures from tutorials—all without starting over.

Ultimately, Schedule Manager transforms chaotic, unstructured data into a polished, reliable schedule that you can actually use—whether you’re planning your week, organizing study sessions, or simply keeping track of your classes. The app takes the stress and uncertainty out of schedule management, leaving you with more time and peace of mind throughout the semester.
